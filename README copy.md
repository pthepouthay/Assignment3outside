# Assignment Three: Blog Management System

## Overview and Guidelines

In this assignment, you will be creating a Blog Management System.  The Blog Management system will allow users to post articles about different topics to the site.  Users will be able to view the articles and post comments on the articles.  For this assignment, your application will be structured using the Model View Controller Pattern that we have covered in class.  The system will support users in three different roles:

**Unauthenticated Users** Users that browse to the home page should be able to navigate all of the topics and read all of the posted articles.  They are not able to perform any other functions on the site including post comments about articles, author articles, or access any administrative tasks.

**Authors** Authors are authenticated users.  They have the ability to create and manage their topics, articles, comments.  Authors should also have a more personalized view of the system that aligns with their tasks and their preferences.

**Admins** Admins are authenticated users. They have the ability to manage all aspects of the system, including users, topics, articles, comments, and any other settings on the system.  Their management access is not restricted to just their articles and comments.  They should have an Administrative Dashboard to manage these aspects.

The following are requirements for this project:

1. Use *Bootstrap CSS Framework*.  Your system should be responsive and view properly on desktops, tables, and phones.
2. Use the MVC Pattern. folder structure, and naming conventions that have been demonstrated and discussed in class.
3. Use the base data model for the starting point for your application.  You may add additional columns and tables as required, but the basic structure of 4.the database (4 tables, Users, Topics, Articles, and Comments) must be retained.
4. Provide a distinct experience for each user role targeted to their tasks and possibly preferences.
5. A presentation and demonstration of your system highlighting it's operations and features will be required.
6. Use your creativity to provide additional features or experiences that are unique for your system.
